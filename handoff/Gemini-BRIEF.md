One-Page Brief — Gemini AI Integration

Objective
- Use Gemini AI to improve audio quality, metadata tagging, and content discovery for gputnam-music-final-site.

Audience
- Internal: product/ops
- External: Gemini team (partnership/demo)

Key Deliverables
- Demo page showing before/after audio samples
- Automated audio-cleanup workflow (instructions + sample inputs)
- Metadata enrichment pipeline (mood, instrumentation, tags)
- Outreach email + contact summary

Constraints
- Keep original WAV/MP3 masters intact
- Use non-destructive processing; provide both original and processed files

Where to find assets
- Repo root `public/assets` and `app` pages; audio ingestion scripts in `scripts/` and `supabase/`.

Success Criteria
- Clear audible improvement on 3 representative tracks
- Enriched metadata for at least 10 tracks (mood + tags)
- A self-contained demo page that plays before/after and documents steps
