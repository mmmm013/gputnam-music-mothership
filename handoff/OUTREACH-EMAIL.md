Subject: Partnership demo — gputnam-music-final-site + Gemini AI

Hi [Gemini Team],

I'm Gregory Putnam, owner of gputnam-music-final-site — a small catalog of original music and educational tracks. I'm exploring working with Gemini AI to: 1) clean and enhance audio masters, 2) auto-enrich metadata (mood/instrumentation), and 3) build a small demo page showing before/after results.

I've prepared a concise brief and repo location. Deliverables I need: processed before/after audio for 3 representative tracks, `metadata.json` with mood/instrumentation tags, and a demo page that plays the results.

If this is interesting, I can provide sample tracks and grant temporary repo access or upload masters. What's the best way to proceed? Would you prefer a short call or a proof-of-concept push?

Best,
Gregory Putnam
