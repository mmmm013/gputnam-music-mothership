# GPMC OPERATIONAL STRATEGY: ENLIVENING THE PLATFORM
**Focus:** Failsafe Delivery, VOC, and MIP "Catering To" Strategy.

## I. THE "FAILSAFE" DELIVERY MODEL
To ensure GPMC is "Best In Class" (BIC), we operate on a **Zero Defect** policy:
1.  **Redundancy:** Code (GH) is separate from Assets (SB).
2.  **The Registry Pattern:** We use a clean `audioRegistry` in code that maps to standardized files.
3.  **Universal Rotation:** The 5-Slot Grid ensures no single point of failure.

## II. MIP STRATEGY: "CATERING TO" COLLABORATORS
**Objective:** Make track placement for MIPs (Scherer, Nelson, Kleigh) as simple/easy as possible.
**The "White Glove" Protocol:**
* **Simple Handoff:** MIPs only need to provide the audio file.
* **Co-Copyright Status:** They are legal partners. The UI explicitly tags them as `CO-COPYRIGHT`.
* **Guaranteed Rotation:** The Dynamic Engine guarantees their tracks rotate into the "Listen" slots.

## III. ADVANCED ENLIVENMENT: BOTS & AUTOMATION
1.  **The Curator BOT (Future):** Analyzes plays to promote high-performing tracks.
2.  **The Notification BOT (Future):** Monitors `tracks` bucket for new uploads.
3.  **The "Hype" BOT (Social):** Auto-posts "Hero Legacy" snippets.
